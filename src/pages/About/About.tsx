              I'm a junior developer who decided to leave teaching behind to
              find out how computers use language instead. Soon after I started
              experimenting with HTML, CSS and JavaScript I realised I'd found
              the perfect cognitive outlet with the right balance of logic,
              utility and creativity. Itâ€™s been a nonstop sprint ever since and
              I'm excited to keep growing and work on exciting and challenging
              projects.
