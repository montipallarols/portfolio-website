              I'm Montaga, a junior developer who decided to leave teaching
              behind to find out how computers use language instead. Soon after
              I started experimenting with HTML, CSS and JavaScript I realised
              I'd found the perfect cognitive outlet with the right balance of
              logic, utility and creativity. Itâ€™s been a nonstop sprint ever
              since and I'm excited to keep growing and work on exciting and
              challenging projects.
